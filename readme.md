# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Ahmed Gamal


## Dataset
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
data wrangling steps:
1-dropping the columns which I won't use 
2-checking the duplicates
3-convertion duration_sec from seconds to minutes
4-visualising the null values
5-droping the null values
6-fixing the data type


## Summary of Findings
1-most of the users are subscribers, the number of subscribers is more than customers around by nine and half time
2-the majority of users are males with a minority of undefined gender (other)
3-the majority of the age of users range between 20 and 40
4-Most of the duration of the trips ranges between 1-20 minutes  
5-the most common start station is Market St at 10th St followed
6- the most common end station is San Francisco Caltrain Station 2
7-the most common trip is between Berry St at 4th St - San Francisco Ferry Building
8-the most common start trip hours are 8:00 and 17:00
9-The largest numbers of trips was recorded Thursday and Tuesday,the lowest numbers of trips was recorded weekends  days and it's nearly equal
10- males are a bit older than Females
11-the Age of subscribers exceeds the customer age by a very small margin
12- the percentage of females (who are a bit younger than males) is more in the customer type
13-The average trip duration in minutes of customers generally are longer than subscribers.
14-the female trips are longer than male trips on average.
15-the pattern of customer type was different from the subscriber type in number of trips by weekdays


## Key Insights for Presentation
I Made a flow for the audience starting with the features of users and how they could affect trips Feature like duration and numbers.

I have started by illustrating the age of all users by histogram. then comparing between different types and gender of the user by box blot and violin plot.

then start comparing the numbers and duration of the trips by user type and gender using bivariate plots like Clustered Bar Charts and multivariate charts like Stacked column chart which I have  preferred that plot than Faceting in Two Directions because it's more interpretable
